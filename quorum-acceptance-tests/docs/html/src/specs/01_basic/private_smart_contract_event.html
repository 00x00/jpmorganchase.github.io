<p>Log events in total are only available in participated parties.
A private smart contract, <code>ClientReceipt</code>, logs all the deposits that have been performed.</p>
<pre><code>pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract ClientReceipt {
    event Deposit(
        address indexed _from,
        bytes32 indexed _id,
        uint _value

    function deposit(bytes32 _id) public payable {
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, _id, msg.value);
    }
