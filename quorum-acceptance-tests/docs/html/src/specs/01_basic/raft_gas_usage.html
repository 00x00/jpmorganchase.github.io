<p>Tags: basic-raft, gas, private</p>
<p>Private contracts with insufficient gas should be handled correctly in all scenarios.
In particular, we need to test the following type of scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private txn is published with marginal gas</li>
<li>Minter is NOT a participant to the transaction and accepts the transaction as it cannot calculate full gas requirement</li>
<li>Block is minted containing the private txn</li>
<li>Block is validated by a node that IS party to the transaction and which calculates the gas usage as higher than that supplied</li>
<li>Block is therefore rejected by the validator
Note that intrinsic gas for the simple contract is approx 57352 and total required gas is approx 115,586</li>
</ul>
<h2>Private contract with gas below intrinsic gas should be rejected (and not remain pending).</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get number of nodes and store as &quot;nodecount&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private transaction where minter is a participant and gas value is &quot;25100&quot;, name this contract as &quot;contract1&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contract &quot;contract1&quot; had exception with message &quot;intrinsic gas too low&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No transactions are pending on node for &quot;contract1&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private transaction where minter is not a participant and gas value is &quot;25100&quot;, name this contract as &quot;contract2&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contract &quot;contract2&quot; had exception with message &quot;intrinsic gas too low&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No transactions are pending on node for &quot;contract2&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check &quot;nodecount&quot; nodes are still running</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Private contract with gas between intrinsic gas and required gas should be rejected (and not remain pending).</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get number of nodes and store as &quot;nodecount&quot;</p>
</li>

</li>

<h2>Private contract with sufficient gas should be accepted.</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Private transaction where minter is a participant and gas value is &quot;120000&quot;, name this contract as &quot;contract5&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contract &quot;contract5&quot; creation succeeded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No transactions are pending on node for &quot;contract5&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private transaction where minter is not a participant and gas value is &quot;120000&quot;, name this contract as &quot;contract6&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contract &quot;contract6&quot; creation succeeded</p>

<li>
<p>No transactions are pending on node for &quot;contract6&quot;</p>
