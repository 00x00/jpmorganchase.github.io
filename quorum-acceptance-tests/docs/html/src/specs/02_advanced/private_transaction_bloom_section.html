<p>Tags: advanced</p>
<p>This related to <strong>Private Smart Contract With Event</strong> specification. But verifying after the next bloom bit section is created.</p>
<p>By default, each bloomb bit section contains 4096 blocks (<code>params/network_params.go</code>). Due to this high number of blocks is required to execute,
we explicitly use <code>raft</code> consensus.</p>
<p>The following smart contract is used:</p>
<pre><code>pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract ClientReceipt {
    event Deposit(
        address indexed _from,
        bytes32 indexed _id,
        uint _value
    );

    function deposit(bytes32 _id) public payable {
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, _id, msg.value);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h2>FIXME: Log events are <strong>only</strong> captured in participated parties when executing the contract</h2>
<p>Tags: raft, pr570</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy <code>ClientReceipt</code> smart contract from a default account in &quot;Node1&quot; and it's private for &quot;Node7&quot;, named this contract as &quot;contract17&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;contract17&quot; is mined</li>
<li>Execute &quot;contract17&quot;'s <code>deposit()</code> function &quot;10&quot; times with arbitrary id and value between original parties</li>
<li>Wait for block height is multiple of &quot;4096&quot; by sending arbitrary public transactions</li>
<li>&quot;Node1&quot; has received transactions from &quot;contract17&quot; which contain &quot;10&quot; log events in state</li>
<li>&quot;Node7&quot; has received transactions from &quot;contract17&quot; which contain &quot;10&quot; log events in state</li>
<li>&quot;Node2&quot; has received transactions from &quot;contract17&quot; which contain &quot;0&quot; log events in state</li>
</ul>
